# Reflex

A [React](https://reactjs.org) framework for [Deno](https://deno.land) and [Oak](https://deno.land/x/oak). It uses React 18's Streaming Server Side Rendering to render the page and serves all files locally.

## Features

- React 18's Streaming Server Side Rendering.
- No bundlers like webpack needed. Use modern ~~Java~~TypeScript.
- Serves all vendor files locally, ensuring that your users get what you expect and you don't need an external CDN.
- Caching out of the box using the Deno cache.

## Getting Started

See https://github.com/Industrial/create-reflex-app for a quick start guide.
